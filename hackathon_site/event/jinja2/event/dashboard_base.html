                    <p class="faqQuestion">When can I expect to hear back?</p>
                    <p class="faqAnswer">Decisions will be sent out in 2 rounds, with the first round on March 10th, and a second round on March 17th for those who are waitlisted.</p>

                    <p class="faqQuestion">Can I compete with a different team than the one I applied with?</p>
                    <p class="faqAnswer">You <strong>cannot</strong> compete with a different team than the one you applied for since we accept applications based on teams. If a situation arises where a member cannot attend, please inform us, and we will address each situation individually.</p>

                    {% if using_teams %}
                        <p class="faqQuestion">I don’t have a team. What can I do?</p>
                        <p class="faqAnswer">If you do not have a team, you can join our <a href="https://discord.gg/eh3dvKhG">Discord</a> and search for teammates in the aws-hack-team-formation channel. All teams must apply in teams of 4.</p>

                        <p class="faqQuestion">Are decisions unanimous for a team?</p>
                        <p class="faqAnswer">Decisions are made unanimously, meaning either your entire team is accepted, or none are admitted.</p>
                    {% endif %}

                    <p class="faqQuestion">Who can I contact if I’ll be late?</p>
                    <p class="faqAnswer">Arriving late is acceptable, but please try to limit your delay to no more than 1-2 hours.</p>

                    <p class="faqQuestion">How does the waitlist work the day of?</p>
                    <p class="faqAnswer">If you have a team of 4 and show up on the day of the event, you will be placed on a walk-in waitlist. Should there be available space due to a no-show team, we will let you in. Admission from the waitlist operates on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important to reach out to one of the IEEE organizers right away.</p>

                    <p class="faqQuestion">Other questions?</p>
